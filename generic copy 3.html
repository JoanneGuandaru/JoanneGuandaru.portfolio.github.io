<h1>Bike Sales Analysis</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>

	<!-- Explanation Text -->
    In this project, I developed an Excel dashboard to analyze the factors influencing bike purchases. The primary objective was to understand the demographic and socio-economic variables driving bike sales. The analysis focused on multiple dimensions, including income, gender, commuter distance, number of children, vehicles owned, age, and occupation. Filters were added for region (Europe, North America, Pacific), marital status (Married, Single), and education level (Bachelorâ€™s, Graduate, High School, Partial College, Partial High School). The data underwent thorough cleaning, including removing duplicates, creating age brackets, and addressing missing data and errors. Pivot tables were also used to examine various attributes.

<h2>Key Findings</h2>

<!-- Explanation Text -->

<h3>Income and Gender Impact on Bike Sales</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Overall:</strong> Men, on average, earn higher incomes ($60,124) than women ($55,774), consistent across all regions. Europe had the largest income gap, with males earning 18% more than females.</li>
    <li><strong>By Region:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>North America:</strong> Highest average income for both men ($65,455) and women ($64,909), making this region highly lucrative for bike sales.</li>
            <li><strong>Europe:</strong> Lowest income levels for bike buyers, with women earning $39,136 and men $46,269.</li>
            <li><strong>Pacific:</strong> Close income levels between genders, with women earning $62,917 and men $65,385.</li>
        </ul>
	<li><strong>By Education:</strong> Graduate degree holders have the highest average income ($68,049 for men, $61,698 for women), while partial high school education shows the largest income disparity, with men earning $58,000 and women $32,000.</li>

</div>

    </li>
    
</ul>
<p><strong>Insight:</strong> Higher income correlates positively with bike sales, especially for men, with the largest disparities seen in Europe and among those with lower education levels.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Target high-income earners with premium models in North America and Graduate Degree holders. In Europe, consider affordable options or targeted promotions for women.</p>

<h3>Commuter Distance</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Overall:</strong> Buyers commuting 0-1 miles purchase the most bikes (200 bikes), making this group a key target. The fewest sales come from those commuting over 10 miles (46 bikes).</li>
    <li><strong>By Region:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Europe:</strong> Short commutes (0-1 miles) dominate bike sales (102 bikes), while over 10 miles is minimal (3 bikes).</li>
            <li><strong>North America:</strong> Prefers medium commutes (2-5 miles, 70 bikes), with a preference for longer distances (5-10 miles) following.</li>
            <li><strong>Pacific:</strong> Mirrors Europe, with short commutes (0-1 miles) accounting for 38 bikes.</li>
        </ul>
