												<h3>Seattle Airbnb Project</h3>
											</header>
											<p>In the Seattle Airbnb Project, I developed a Tableau dashboard to analyze Seattle’s Airbnb market, aiming to help a client identify the best location to start a new Airbnb business. Using data from the Seattle Airbnb Open Data on Kaggle, I focused on key factors such as competition levels, average price per bedroom, zip code, property type, and seasonal revenue trends to assess profitability across different areas. Through comprehensive data cleaning and analysis, I joined listings and calendar data to examine booking trends, price variations, and occupancy rates throughout the year. This analysis provides actionable insights into high-demand zip codes, optimal property types, and seasonal revenue patterns, guiding investment decisions for maximizing returns in Seattle's competitive Airbnb market.</p>

												<h3>Bike Sales Analysis Project</h3>
											</header>
											<p>In the Bike Sales Project, I used Excel dashboards to analyze bike sales data acquired from Kaggle, examining how various demographic and socio-economic factors influence purchasing patterns. By focusing on key variables such as income, gender, commuter distance, age, number of children, car ownership, and occupation, I aimed to uncover trends and insights that shape bike sales across different regions (Europe, North America, and Pacific). The data was meticulously cleaned to ensure accuracy, including steps like removing duplicates, categorizing age brackets, and resolving missing or erroneous data. Leveraging pivot tables and interactive dashboards, I explored attributes like marital status and education level to offer a comprehensive view of the factors driving bike purchases. This analysis provides valuable insights into the target demographics for bike marketing strategies, with detailed findings on factors such as income and gender impact, commuter distance preferences, and regional trends.</p>
